# Template email for initial involvement/introduction meeting

Hi!

Me and Daniel (my supervisor) have been working/brainstorming on an initiative (https://science-collective.org/) to improve how science is currently done, with the general aim being to create the technical and social environment that scientists need to carry out genuinely collaborative, open, reproducible, and accessible science.

Maybe a bit vague but also ambitious? The website has some more details, and for now we're keeping our aims small and focused. Our first aims are to 1) start building a community, 2) write out and agree on basic guiding principles and values on how to do science, and 3) develop some procedures, workflows, and standards by working on an example project together.

We're emailing each of you because we thought you might be interested in a project like this, either because we've had discussions on this before or because you explicitly said you wanted to be part of a project like this.

We're planning a half-day virtual "introduction and brainstorming meeting" on 25-11-2021 at 16:00 CET (Copenhagen time) for maybe 2, max 3 hours. 16:00 might be a bit late for some of you in Denmark, but we had to choose a time that would work for those in Canada too (if they are interested).

A basic agenda is here https://github.com/science-collective/website/issues/7 and the Zoom link is below. 

The aim of the meeting is to start building the community and getting people together to work on this initiative and problem. If you are interested in attending or can't attend but are interested in being involved in this initiative, let us know!

If you know any others who might be interested in this, forward this along to them too! Looking forward to hearing from you :)
