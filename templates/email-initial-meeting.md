# Template email for initial involvement/introduction meeting

Hi!

We're starting an initiative (https://science-collective.org/) to work towards improving 
how science is currently done by creating the technical and 
social environment that scientists need to carry out 
genuinely collaborative, open, reproducible, and accessible science.

A bit ambitious? We're starting small of course!
Our first aim is to 1) start building a community, 2) write out and
agree on basic guiding principles and values on how to do science, and
3) develop some procedures, workflows, and standards on doing science.

We're emailing you because we thought you would be interested in a project like this,
based on discussions we've had (or because you explicitly said you wanted to be part of
a project like this).

We're planning a half-day virtual "introduction and brainstorming meeting" on DATE at TIME (ZOOM LINK).
The aim of the meeting is to start building the community and getting people together to
work on this initiative and problem.
If you are interested in attending or are interested in being involved in this initiative, let us know!

Looking forward to hearing from you!
