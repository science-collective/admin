# Template email for initial involvement/introduction meeting

Hi!

We're starting an initiative (https://science-collective.org/) to work towards improving 
how science is currently done by creating the technical and 
social environment that scientists need to carry out 
genuinely collaborative, open, reproducible, and accessible science.

A bit ambitious? We're starting small of course!
Our first aims are to 1) start building a community, 2) write out and
agree on basic guiding principles and values on how to do science,
3) develop some procedures, workflows, and standards by working on an example project together.

We're emailing you because we thought you would be interested in a project like this,
based on discussions we've had (or because you explicitly said you wanted to be part of
a project like this).

We're planning a half-day virtual "introduction and brainstorming meeting" on 25-11-2021 at 16:00 CET (Copenhagen time). Please see the Zoom link below.
The aim of the meeting is to start building the community and getting people together to work on this initiative and problem.
If you are interested in attending or are interested in being involved in this initiative, let us know!

If you can't join the meeting on the 25th but are still interested in participating or hearing more please let us know and we will add your name to our mailing list for the next event.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
